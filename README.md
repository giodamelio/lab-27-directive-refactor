 * require your **base.scss**
 * setup angular and create a controller for adding cowsay logic

# Client Functionality
* create a page with a form and two pre tags
 * one pre tag should be a preview, showing the result of `cowsay.say` with two way data-binding to an input on the form
 * the second pre tag should be final view, populated with what ever the first pretag shows when ever the submit button on the form is triggered
 * feel free to add any features or styling you want

# Bonus
* **1pt** add a third button to the form that uses the `ng-click` directive
 * whenever this button is clicked it should reset the second pretag with the content it last showed
* **1pt** add a select menu that uses the `ng-repeat` directive
 * use the `ng-repeat` to populate the select menu with the names of all cowsay files
 * when a cowsay filename is selected from the menu, have both pre-tags use that cowfile
